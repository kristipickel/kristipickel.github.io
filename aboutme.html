    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey, I am Kristi, thank you for visitng my page.  I am am elder millennial who has decided to go back to school to change careers. My experience in life has taken me from customer service in the tourist industry, through the insurance sector, website development, and most recently the global supply chain as an Import Project Manager.  I have always been interested in coding and would like to do more every day that brings fullfillment and helps people.  Currently enrolled at MIT xPro's Women's Cohort Bootcamp learning the MERN stack. See my portfolio page to see some of the projects I have completed so far. </p>
